    I am Ninad Mhatre, I am from Mumbai, India. I am currently working as Python QA Automation developer in Amsterdam, the Netherlands with FlowTrades. I am a software developer by profession since 2006 & traveller since I started earning.

    I moved into QA space from Development in 2015, reason for this was to understand the business. I worked on Perl, C# & little bit with C++ before moving to Python.
